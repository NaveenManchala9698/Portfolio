        "My first interaction with Naveen was during the build week project at Epicode. Our task was to recreate the LinkedIn web page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and React JS. I found him helpful and patient. He was able to handle stress during tight deadlines. He has an extensive knowledge in deploying various Frontend tools. It was a pleasure working together with him and I would highly recommend him. üëç",
